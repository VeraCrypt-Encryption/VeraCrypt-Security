## What is VeraCrypt?

**VeraCrypt** is a powerful, free, and open-source encryption software designed to help users protect their data through advanced cryptographic methods. It is the successor to TrueCrypt and has been extensively audited and improved for modern security needs. VeraCrypt allows users to encrypt files, partitions, and entire storage devices, supporting a wide range of encryption standards including AES, Serpent, and Twofish.

One of the standout features of VeraCrypt is its ability to create hidden volumes, providing plausible deniability—a critical feature for users in high-risk environments. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile choice for multi-platform users.

VeraCrypt is used by journalists, activists, businesses, and privacy-conscious individuals around the world to secure sensitive information from unauthorized access. Its user-friendly interface and detailed documentation make it accessible even to those new to encryption.
